Radar-Based Object Detection System with Arduino

🌟 Overview

This is a real-time radar system project built using Arduino UNO, an ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor. It scans the surroundings in a 150° arc and detects objects based on distance. A buzzer and LED act as alerts depending on proximity. Data is visualized in real-time using Processing IDE, creating a radar-like UI that maps angle and distance.

🚀 Key Features

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) mounted on a Servo sweeps from 15° to 165°.

Buzzer + LED act as proximity alerts:

Fast beep/blink for objects < 5cm

Medium beep/blink for objects < 15cm

Processing IDE reads serial data from Arduino and creates a dynamic radar-like graphical interface.

Objects within 40 cm are tracked and shown on the radar display.
